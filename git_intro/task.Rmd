# i made some changes here in RStudio and saved them


## required packages
```{r load packages}
library(ggplot2)
```
## YAML header

1. Add your full name and date to the RMarkdown document in the YAML header

<mark>done easily</mark>

## Plot the famous *Iris* data

2. Here, add a scatter plot of the iris data set depicting Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width
variables and print the figure and the code snippet.

<mark> how to make *iris* appear in italic in the title?<mark>


```{r scatterplot-sepal.lenght~sepal.width}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, color=Species)) +
geom_point()+
  ggtitle("Sepal size of three *Iris* species") +
labs(
x="Length [cm]",
y="Width [cm]")
```


## Image

3. Here, add the file git_intro/markdown_meme.jpg to the document

HINT: If this wasn't covered in the course, just google it ;)

<mark> using the url from github, no picture was added correctly. Maybe, because you need a permission (login), although i was logged in. So, i inserted another picture for the first step. The idea comes from: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28912868/how-to-insert-image-from-url-in-markdown><mark>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Define variable containing url
url <- "https://www.online-image-editor.com/styles/2014/images/example_image.png"
```
![another cat](`r url`)

<mark> so here the meme downloaded to my hard drive and inserted afterwards <mark>

## Formula

4. Here, add a formula which calculates the Toxic Unit of a concentration (ci) and and
EC50 value together with the corresponding text (see Markdown slides).

$$ sumTU = log10 \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{c_i}{EC_{50_i}} \right) $$

where $$ c_i $$  is the concentration of the pesticide *i* and $$ EC_{50_i}$$ is the concentration of pesticide $$i$$ at which 50 % of the test organisms (*Daphnia magna*) were affected.

<mark> would had been so nice, but this looks ugly.. ok, lets do it like this </mark>

where *c<sub>i</sub>* is the concentration of the pesticide *i* and EC<sub>*50i*</sub> is the
concentration of pesticide *i* at which 50% of the test organisms
(*Daphnia magna*) were affected.

## Other

5. Add a table of contents to the document.
